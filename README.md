# TienNu - Music streaming app

The TienNu online music streaming app is a software that allows users to access and enjoy music via the internet. Unlike downloading and storing music on a device, an online music streaming app uses streaming technology to transmit audio from a server to a client device in real time. This way, users can listen to music anytime, anywhere, without needing to use storage space.
